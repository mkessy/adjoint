# Comprehensive Testing Strategy for Graph Engine

## Overview

This testing suite provides **uncompromising mathematical correctness** validation for the graph engine implementation. We test not just functionality, but the mathematical laws and invariants that must hold for a correct computational graph system.

## Test Categories

### 1. **Graph Composition Tests** (`GraphComposition.test.ts`)

Tests the high-level compositional API that allows building computational graphs declaratively.

**Mathematical Properties Tested:**

- **Identity Law**: `from(A).transform(id) ≡ from(A)`
- **Associativity**: `(f ∘ g) ∘ h ≡ f ∘ (g ∘ h)`
- **Type Safety**: Composition preserves type relationships
- **Graph Structure**: Proper edge relationships in compositions

**Key Test Cases:**

- Single schema node composition
- Chain of transformations
- Edge relationship validation
- Error handling for malformed graphs

### 2. **Graph Algebra Tests** (`GraphAlgebra.test.ts`)

Tests the mathematical algebras used for graph traversal and computation.

**Mathematical Properties Tested:**

- **Catamorphism Laws**: Proper fold behavior
- **Compositional Properties**: `count(p1 ∧ p2) ≤ min(count(p1), count(p2))`
- **Non-negativity**: All counts are ≥ 0
- **Determinism**: Same input produces same output
- **Performance**: Large graphs handled efficiently

**Algebras Tested:**

- `count` - Node counting with optional predicates
- `collectIds` - ID collection preserving count invariants
- `drawTree` - String representation generation

### 3. **Node Capabilities Tests** (`NodeCapabilities.test.ts`)

Tests the predicate system and capability registry with rigorous logical validation.

**Mathematical Properties Tested:**

- **Boolean Algebra Laws**:

  - Commutativity: `P ∧ Q ≡ Q ∧ P`, `P ∨ Q ≡ Q ∨ P`
  - Associativity: `(P ∧ Q) ∧ R ≡ P ∧ (Q ∧ R)`
  - Identity Elements: `P ∧ true ≡ P`, `P ∨ false ≡ P`
  - De Morgan's Laws: `¬(P ∧ Q) ≡ ¬P ∨ ¬Q`
  - Double Negation: `¬¬P ≡ P`

- **Equivalence Relation Laws**:

  - Reflexivity: `a ≡ a`
  - Symmetry: `a ≡ b ⟹ b ≡ a`
  - Transitivity: `a ≡ b ∧ b ≡ c ⟹ a ≡ c`

- **Ordering Relation Laws**:
  - Antisymmetry: `a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ a ⟹ a = b`
  - Transitivity: `a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ c ⟹ a ≤ c`
  - Totality: `∀a,b: a ≤ b ∨ b ≤ a`

### 4. **Graph Operations Tests** (`GraphOperations.test.ts`)

Tests the graph query operations (filter, find, sort) with mathematical rigor.

**Mathematical Properties Tested:**

- **Filter Properties**:

  - Idempotency: `filter(P, filter(P, G)) = filter(P, G)`
  - Monotonicity: `|filter(P, G)| ≤ |G|`
  - Predicate Preservation: All filtered nodes satisfy predicate
  - Identity with `true`: `filter(true, G) = G`
  - Nullity with `false`: `filter(false, G) = ∅`

- **Find Properties**:

  - Result Satisfaction: Found nodes satisfy predicate
  - Determinism: Same predicate yields same result
  - Empty Graph Behavior: Returns `None` for empty graphs

- **Sort Properties**:
  - Count Preservation: Sorting preserves node count
  - Determinism: Multiple sorts yield identical results
  - Ordering Laws: Sorted sequence respects ordering relation

### 5. **Property-Based Tests** (`PropertyBasedTests.test.ts`)

Uses generative testing to validate properties across large input spaces.

**Property Categories:**

- **Algebraic Laws**: Automatically generated test cases for mathematical properties
- **Invariant Preservation**: Properties that must hold regardless of input
- **Composition Laws**: How operations compose correctly
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation under invalid inputs
- **Performance**: Operations complete within acceptable time bounds

**Generators:**

- Random node generation with all node types
- Random graph generation with various sizes
- Random predicate generation with known properties
- Edge case generation (empty graphs, single nodes, etc.)

## Test Execution Strategy

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test categories
pnpm test:math          # Property-based mathematical tests
pnpm test:algebra       # Algebra correctness tests
pnpm test:capabilities  # Predicate and capability tests
pnpm test:composition   # Graph composition tests
pnpm test:operations    # Graph operation tests

# Coverage analysis
pnpm test:coverage

# Watch mode for development
pnpm test:watch
```

### Test Configuration

- **Timeout**: 10 seconds per test (mathematical proofs can be complex)
- **Threads**: 1-4 threads for parallel execution
- **Coverage**: 80% threshold for branches, functions, lines, statements
- **Property Tests**: 100 runs per property (configurable)
- **Bail**: Fail fast on first error for mathematical correctness

### Error Handling Philosophy

**Zero Tolerance for Mathematical Errors:**

- Tests fail immediately on any mathematical law violation
- Property-based tests run extensive random cases
- Edge cases are explicitly tested
- Performance requirements are enforced

**Graceful Degradation:**

- Operations on empty graphs don't throw
- Invalid predicates are handled safely
- Malformed inputs produce predictable results

## Mathematical Correctness Guarantees

This test suite ensures:

1. **Categorical Laws**: All composition operations satisfy category theory laws
2. **Boolean Algebra**: All predicate operations satisfy boolean algebra
3. **Order Theory**: All ordering operations satisfy order theory laws
4. **Set Theory**: All graph operations respect set-theoretic properties
5. **Performance**: All operations complete in reasonable time bounds

## Continuous Validation

The test suite is designed to catch:

- **Logic Errors**: Violations of mathematical laws
- **Performance Regressions**: Operations becoming too slow
- **Type Safety Issues**: Incorrect type relationships
- **Edge Case Failures**: Unexpected behavior on boundary conditions
- **Concurrency Issues**: Race conditions in parallel operations

## Adding New Tests

When adding new functionality:

1. **Identify Mathematical Properties**: What laws must the new feature satisfy?
2. **Write Property Tests**: Use generative testing for broad coverage
3. **Add Specific Cases**: Test known edge cases and examples
4. **Validate Performance**: Ensure operations scale appropriately
5. **Check Error Handling**: Verify graceful failure modes

## Integration with CI/CD

This test suite integrates with continuous integration to:

- Run on every commit
- Generate coverage reports
- Fail builds on mathematical law violations
- Provide detailed error reports for debugging
- Track performance metrics over time

The goal is **mathematical correctness without compromise** - if a test fails, it indicates a fundamental flaw in the implementation that must be fixed before proceeding.
